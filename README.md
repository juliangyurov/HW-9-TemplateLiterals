Homework Assignment #9: Template Literals


Details:
 
Now that you know how template literals work, you've probably got a few ideas of how you improve Project #1. So for this assignment, return to project #1 and upgrade your code to use template literals. That is, specifically:

1. Modify your pages so that all of the HTML within the <body> is written by Javascript (rather than hardcoded onto the page).

2. Break all your HTML into separate Javascript templates, using template literals.

3. Make sure that any variables that appear are not harcoded, but are presented via those template literals. Keep your templates free of as much text and numbers as possible, pushing all that data into variables instead.


Extra Credit:

In addition to template-izing the <body> see if you can do so for the some of the <head> tags like the <title> and various pieces of meta data.
